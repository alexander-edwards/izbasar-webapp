# Description of Back-End Architecture

Main Technologies for Back-End are: Spring Boot and Database(???)

## API

This is only rough example of possible APIs

1. User:

   - Mentor:
     a) High School, City, Country, Graduation Year
     b) University, City, Country, Graduation Year
     c) Bio
   - Mentee:
     a) Bio

2. Blogs (Can Possible get ready templates):

   - Author = Either Mentor or Mentee
   - Headings
   - Sub-headings
   - Content
   - Media

## Technologies

## Springboot

- Spring boot vx.x.0
- Java - OpenJDK11

## Database

We should decide on which DB to use. Potentials:

1. PostgreSQL - I have used it with Django. Works pretty well
2. MongoDB
3. MySQL
